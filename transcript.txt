Title: "OMG! SpaceX Starship Flight 5 Launch to Booster Catching! Full Video - YouTube"
Transcript: "(00:00) our propellant load on the ship and the booster so  10 million pounds of propellant on that vehicle on   the pad here at Starbase getting ready to go we're  going to start uh clearing out all of the lines   that are basically pushing all of that propellant  to the vehicles those get cleaned out or cleared   out on the ground before we lift off we're doing  some final checks on the vehicle the thrust VOR   thrust vector control that we're going to use  to steer it um as well as uh the guidance system (00:30) doing its final alignment just a lot of our our  final checkouts but uh we are we are starting   to hear that it looks like the range is going  to be clear at our liftoff time of 7:25 a.m.   Central 12:25 UTC so that puts us one minute  20 seconds away from launch still not tracking   any technical issues that range clear is the  only thing that's been potentially poking at   our launch so I'm going to start to quiet down  we'll hear our flight director for today Tristan   Pierce give some of the final call outs as of  right now we are one minute away from liftoff (01:41) flight directors go for launch best words you could possibly  hear 20 seconds away from liftoff tus 5 4 3 2 1 we have left vehicle pitching down range pressure nominal 30 seconds into the flight the rubel's  just starting to reach us here at launch control booster and Shi avionics  power tet nominal three Raptor (03:01) engines Max Q now pass through the maximum aerodynamic   pressure the most stress the vehicle  is going to see on the way uphill all right our next our next major Milestone  coming up it's going to be hot staging we're   going to see the engines ignite  on ship to push it away from the booster all right so hot stent going to  be the next thing coming up first we're   going to see the boosters engines start  to shut down all but three we're going (04:09) to do what's called most engines cut  off instead of main engine cut off cuz   three are going to keep going and then  we're going to see the engines on ship ignite right now the tower  team is doing their go no go we might hear some really good words soon too all right can still see it up behind me that is one   of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen  in my entire life coming up on hot staging next ship engine start post engines cut off stage separation booster separation  stage conf separation (05:03) confirmed ship under its own power I'm seeing  six out of six Raptors lit hopefully I got a   booster on the way back to me I'm going to  send to see you guys in Hawthorne oh man   that was absolutely incredible I loved how the  crowd chamber pressure is nominal crowd here   in Hawthorne all went oo at that first view of  the blue flames from the booster as you can see there first stage currently performing or  excuse me is uh now making its way back to   uh the launch site again we are ship avionics  power andry nominal uh the booster and the (05:45) tower are both performing automated checks to  make sure we are go for the booster to return   to the Launchpad for that catch and once those  are complete the flight director booster boost shut booster and we did hear that the tower is go for catch so  that was one of the big criteria we were looking for we'll wait to hear that the we'll wait  to hear that the go for catch has been sent beautiful view here from the ship and  so exciting to hear that we got a go for   booster catch that means it's going to be a  really exciting morning again the booster is (06:36) making its way back towards uh now land um  in order to make that catch attempt in the tower so incredible to see these views you  can see the ship on the right hand side of   your screen all six Raptor engines are uh  Under full power once again the the ship   excuse me the booster is making it way back to  the launch site we are going to try and catch   it using the chopsticks on the launch Tower  the exact same tower that it just launched   from just wow five minutes ago yeah the  booster Starship on nominal I can confirm (07:18) the command was sent for the booster to come  back that is incredible looking up right now   it's it's pretty much right over ahead of  us and we can see it starting to come down I can't wait for us to hear the sonic boom  through Dan's mic right that is going to be   incredible it was so cool to hear the liftoff  uh and so once again um a successful ontime   liftoff of Starship flight 5 the ship uh the  has separated from the booster the booster is   there on your screen it is making its way  back to the launch site we are going to (07:56) attempt the catch using the Chopsticks  we did hear here the confirmation that   the command was sent to the tower uh we are  go for catch and in order to guys we should   just be about 30 seconds away from our Landing  burn it's going to happen in three phases we   13 engines burn off all of that velocity  oh we can see it coming down through the plume booster coming in  hot for booster catch going   13 of those Raptor engines and  this view is incredible right now you can see how fast this  vehicle is moving on the left (08:42) hand [Music] Landing we're  now down to three Raptor   engines we can see those Chopsticks now in here shut this is absolutely insane  the firstever attempt we have   successfully caught the super  heavy booster back to what an incredible are you kidding [Music] me uh d uh I don't know about you  but we're we're losing our stuff   up here guys I'm I'm sorry like  even in this day and age what we"
